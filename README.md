# Seller Management System

## Overview

This Seller Management System is a project developed in 2021 to facilitate the management of sellers and associated data. It serves as a bridge between E-commerce administrators and sellers. Through a mobile application, sellers can register and showcase their products on the website. The system operates based on real-time actions, allowing administrators to approve, reject, or transfer product and price change requests.

## Features

- **Seller Management:** Add, edit, and remove sellers with ease.
- **Role-Based Permissions:** 'Staff,' 'Admin,' and 'Management' team members have specific actions such as approving, reporting, rejecting product and price change requests, adding and blocking sellers, assigning product categories, creating warehouses shown on the mobile application, and generating reports.
- **User Authentication:** Ensure secure access with Firebase Authentication.
